This web application gives you a glimpse into the social media experience of the original 151 Pokemon. Through this app, designed to look like a Pokedex, a user can select a Pokemon, the "viewing Pokemon," to engage with the app. A profile card and the posts of the viewing Pokemon show up in the left hand of the screen. The second dropdown menu on the right allows the user to check out the posts made by any Pokemon which the viewing Pokemon is following. Users can create a post from a form in the profile card of the viewing Pokemon, which is hidden until the "+ Post" button is clicked. Users can like any post, either the viewing Pokemon's own or those of any of the Pokemon the viewing Pokemon follows. The posts of the viewing Pokemon can be deleted, but posts of the profiles of Pokemon the viewing Pokemon follows cannot be deleted. 

The frontend of the site is built using vanilla Javascript and Bootstrap for CSS. The backend is made with a Ruby on Rails API. ( Backend: https://github.com/BennyLouie/poke_insta_api )
